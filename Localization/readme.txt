# Questions and Answers
---

Q: Why are all files labeled as C header files, when this is a Game Maker project?
A: This is for improved syntax highlighting; GitHub does not have, at the present time, readable syntax highlighting for Game Maker strings

Q: How do I contribute to this project?
A: Contact me via Twitter or our SMA Discord server, and we can add you as a contributor to this project!
Server Link: https://discord.gg/Z855AHw

Q: How do I look at both the English scripts and my own language's scripts at the same time?
A: On Windows 8.1 (and above) or on Linux, open 2 instances of your browser or choice, and click + drag each window to the opposite sides of your screen; your OS will let you create a "splitscreen" view of the text files this way.

Q: Can I use Visual Studio Code, or another local app, to directly work on the language scripts, then make pull requests like with other projects?
A: Yes, you can! If you are more-than-familiar with GitHub's workflow, as well as your most comfortable IDE of choice, I would also accept push/pull requests.

Q: I am new to using GitHub, where can I ask questions if I am stuck?
A: GitHub does not hae a Direct Message feature (anymore), our SMA Discord server is available for this purpose, where we all collaborate on the game together. If neither Twitter DMs or Discord is appealing, you may contact me via email!
