---------------------

Ability to rotate tiles in 90Â° increments -Deckard

A loop logic controller for wall-running, as well as running on the ground -frogmoss10

Make the dpad on the controller snap to editor options to the right -El_Nacho

Allow Lilac's uppercut to work on walls and ceilings in the way that it does in Freedom Planet 2 -Deckard

A transition system which allows a level to span multiple map files, instead of one, both to defeat the 16,000 tile limitation *and* create a sensation of progression in stages. This could be done via stage.map, stage.sub1, stage.sub2, etc, file naming, so that the game can distinguish "sub-world" maps from maps that start a stage, or only have one map file.
