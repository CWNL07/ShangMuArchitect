# Community Suggestions

When reporting suggestions for the game, or feature wishlists, tag them as "Feature Suggestion". If the developers consider the suggestion as part of the game's future updates, they will be copied here, and the opened ticket will be tagged as "Closed", to improve the visibility of critical bugs being reported on the issues page.

## Accepted suggestions are detailed here

- Ability to rotate tiles in 90Â° increments -Deckard
- A loop logic controller for wall-running, as well as running on the ground -frogmoss10
- Make the dpad on the controller snap to editor options to the right -El_Nacho
- Allow Lilac's uppercut to work on walls and ceilings in the way that it does in Freedom Planet 2 -Deckard
- A transition system which allows a level to span multiple map files, instead of one, both to defeat the 16,000 tile limitation *and* create a sensation of progression in stages. This could be done via stage.map, stage.sub1, stage.sub2, etc, file naming, so that the game can distinguish "sub-world" maps from maps that start a stage, or only have one map file.
- Level names could be longer -NBlast
- Make the d-pad snap the cursor to the editor's sidebar -Nacho
- Improve Lilac's uppercut attack so that it can launch Lilac from walls as well as ceilings, like it can in FP2 -Deckard
