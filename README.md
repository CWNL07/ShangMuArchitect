**Bug Classes**
---------------

When reporting bugs, please refer to this bugs classification list when tagging your reports:
```
A)
	Game crashes
	System crashes
	Asset data loads with corruption
	Other catastrophic scenarios that prevent the game from executing more code
B)
	Game doesn't crash, but progression is impossible. (For instance, a loop that doesn't work and stops the player from finishing the level.)
	Save files or map data corrupts
C)
	Game doesn't crash and progression is still possible, but the technical workings of certain features are distinctly not polished
	Menus and notification messages don't behave as well as they should
	Collision physics issues, such as clipping through floors or walls
D)
	This bug may be seen as a minor nuisance, such as sound effects bleeding, or sounds playing louder than the volume settings defined
	A combat move is imbalanced, or a graphical tile is misplaced compared to where it should be.)
	A combat move is working correctly, but its exact behavior is inaccurate when compared to Freedom Planet

Ability to rotate tiles in 90Â° increments -Deckard

A loop logic controller for wall-running, as well as running on the ground -frogmoss10

Make the dpad on the controller snap to editor options to the right -El_Nacho

Allow Lilac's uppercut to work on walls and ceilings in the way that it does in Freedom Planet 2 -Deckard

A transition system which allows a level to span multiple map files, instead of one, both to defeat the 16,000 tile limitation *and* create a sensation of progression in stages. This could be done via stage.map, stage.sub1, stage.sub2, etc, file naming, so that the game can distinguish "sub-world" maps from maps that start a stage, or only have one map file.
